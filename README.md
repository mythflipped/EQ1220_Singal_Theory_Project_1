# EQ1220_Singal_Theory_Project_1

The Project contains 2 part. 
The first part contains concepts related to parameter estimation and other signal properties, involving both mathematical derivations and visual representations to be able to formulate rigorous conclusions. 
The second part uses realistic examples, again using mathematical derivations and visual representations, to investigate models of systems with Gaussian noise.


In Task1 and Task2 you will learn how to calculate the first and second-order moments of the Gaussian distribution and plot the empirical cumulative distribution function. 
In Task4 and 5, you will use the method of periodograms to determine the normalized frequency of a system, and when this was difficult in dB scale, so you will convert it to the normal scale to determine it. The effect of colored noise on the normalized frequency of the periodogram is then investigated. 
In Task6 and 7, you will the ACF and power spectrum of the AR(1) process using the equations studied in class mostly with convolution.
